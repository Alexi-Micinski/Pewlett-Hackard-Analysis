# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview:

Pewlett Hackard is looking ahead to fill positions after employees retire. There is a need to know who will be retiring and how many positions will need to be filled. This will be done by generating a list of all employees who are eligible for the retirement package and building an employee database from csv files.

Then, the number of retiring employees, and identity of employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program will be determined. A report will describe the state of the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

  * A table was create for employee number, name, title, and years of employment. It should be noted that there are duplicate entries for employees that have switched titles during their employment.

  * The duplicate rows were removed from the table and the table was modified to hold only the most recent employee titles. Employees that have left the company were also removed and therefore the employee IDs are not sequential in this table.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
  * How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  
  * Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  *
